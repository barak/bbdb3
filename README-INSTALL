To compile and install BBDB with `make':

0) (BBDB development version only)

   Configure the configure process:

   Run `autogen.sh' in the top directory of the BBDB code.
   This creates the `configure' script required for step 1).

1) Configure the build process:

   Run the `configure' script in the top directory of the BBDB code.
   This performs a number of checks on your system and generates the
   Makefiles accordingly.  You need at least GNU Emacs 23.

   The `configure' script comes with various options:

   `--with-vm-dir=DIR' specifies the path where VM can be found.
     Without this option the resulting BBDB build does not support VM.

   `--with-lispdir=DIR' specifies where to install the lisp files.

   Use `configure --help' to see all available options.

2) Build BBDB:

   To build BBDB type 'make'.

   If you use the BBDB development version, but you do not have autoconf,
   go to the lisp directory and type 'make --makefile=./makefile-temp'.

3) Install BBDB:

   To install BBDB type `make install'.
   This installs all files in their usual system directories.
   You can override these defaults via respective options
   for the configure script.

   The TeX files in the tex directories are installed in ${datadir}
   which defaults to /usr/local/share/bbdb/.  These files are only
   used by BBDB.  They need not be made known to your local TeX
   installation.  See the user variable bbdb-print-tex-path below.

   `make install' is not required to run BBDB.

4) Activate BBDB:

   i)   If the BBDB lisp files are in a directory
        "/path/to/bbdb/lisp" you can use in your emacs init file

        (require 'bbdb-loaddefs "/path/to/bbdb/lisp/bbdb-loaddefs.el")

        This adds "/path/to/bbdb/lisp" to the load-path; so it is all
        you need to make BBDB known to your Emacs.

   ii)  The user variable bbdb-print-tex-path should point to the directory
        where the BBDB TeX files reside (default /usr/local/share/bbdb).
